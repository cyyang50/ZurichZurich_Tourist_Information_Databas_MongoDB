# ZurichZurich_Tourist_Information_Databas_MongoDB
## Introduction
As a traveller, it is often hard to decide what to do and where to go in an unfamiliar city. To assist travellers to make the most of their stay in Zurich, this project builds a Zurich Tourist Information database with MongoDB via Python
Jupyter Notebook. This “zurich_tourist” database includes information on restaurants, attractions, and sports activities in Zurich. The database can be used as a guide for Zurich tourist information. With this database,
travellers could easily explore the various cuisine, sightseeing and recreation.
